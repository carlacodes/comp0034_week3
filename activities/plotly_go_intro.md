# Introduction to Plotly Go



## Adding plotly go charts to the Lollapalooza dashboard

This activity assumes you have already completed the 'Introduction to plotly express' activities as it continues the
Lollapalooza dashboard by addressing the final two questions:

- Where did she go during the festival?
- Which concerts did she watch?

## Add a map to answer 'Where did she go during the festival?'

"The data only tells us the name of the location where I made the purchase, and the festival took place at Aut√≥dromo de
Interlagos.

I took the map with the stages from here and used the georeferencer tool from georeference.com to get the latitude and
longitude coordinates for the stages.

We need to display a map and the markers for each purchase, so we will use Mapbox and the scattermapbox trace.

You will need to [generate a mapbox token from the mapbox site](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-access-token/) and
then place your token in the first line of code after the import statements in the code below. You will need to create
an account to do this. If you don't feel comfortable in signing up then you can skip this chart."

```python
mapbox_token = ""  # Add your mapbox token here

df = pd.read_csv("../data/stages.csv")

trace = go.Scattermapbox(lat=df["latitude"], lon=df["longitude"], text=df["stage"], marker=go.Marker(size=10),
                         mode="markers+text", textposition="top left")

data = [trace]

layout = go.Layout(mapbox=dict(accesstoken=mapbox_token, center=dict(lat=-23.701057, lon=-46.6970635), zoom=14.5))

figure = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)

```

## Add a table to guess the concerts she attended based only on purchases

"Ideally, when we are watching a show, we are watching the show (and not buying stuff), so the purchases should be made
before or after each concert. I then made a list of each concert happening one hour before, one hour after, and
according to the time the purchase was made.

To find out which one of these shows I attended, I calculated the distance from the location of the purchase to each
stage. The shows I attended should be the ones with the shortest distance to the concessions.

As we want to show each data point, the best choice for a visualization is a table."

The data file is `data/concerts_I_attended.csv`

The code to prepare the data is in the function `prepare_data.prepare_concert_data(df)`

Add the code to create the figure using the data from the data file to `dash_app.py`.

```python
file_path_concert = Path(__file__).parent.joinpath('data', 'concerts_I_attended.csv')
df_table = pd.read_csv(file_path_concert)
df_table = prepare_data.prepare_concert_data(df_table)

trace_table = go.Table(header=dict(values=["Concert", "Date", "Correct?"], fill=dict(color=("rgb(82,187,47)"))),
                       cells=dict(values=[df_table.concert, df_table.date, df_table.correct],
                                  font=dict(color=([df_table.color]))))

data = [trace_table]
fig_table = go.Figure(data=data)
```

Write the code to create the table in the app layout.

Re-run the Dash app.
