# comp0034_week2

This week there are 3 directories in the repository:

1. `web_app_intro` contains examples of html and css that are consistent with the lecture notes. Use these to follow along with the lecturer and modify them to see the effect of change.
You will need a code editor that can view and edit HTML and CSS. Jupyter notebooks are not suited to this, you would need to use an IDE such as PyCharm or an online editor such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) which can be convenient to quickly write and see HTML, CSS and JavaScript combined.
2. `plotly_express` contains Jupyter notebooks for learning to use Plotly Express and creating choropleth maps. There is also a notebook that explores how to save maps to html which we will then view in a web browser. You may wish to use your IDE (e.g. PyCharm) or Binder for these activities.

3. `flask_app` contains a basic Flask web app that displays two of the charts created in the activities in the `plotly_express` directory. Ideally you should use an IDE such as PyCharm for this. If you need an online IDE then [Pythonanywhere](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Flask/) allows Flask apps to be created and run online, however you will need to read their documentation as there are some minor differences in how you configure Flask to run online.
