# comp0034_week3

This week there are w directories in the repository:

1. `plotly_express` contains Jupyter notebooks for learning to use Plotly Express and creating choropleth maps. There is also a notebook that explores how to save maps to html which we will then view in a web browser. You may wish to use your IDE (e.g. PyCharm) or Binder for these activities.

- [] TODO: Notebook - choropeth of census data not displaying correctly

2. `flask_app` contains a basic Flask web app that displays two of the charts created in the activities in the `plotly_express` directory. Ideally you should use an IDE such as PyCharm for this. If you need an online IDE then [Pythonanywhere](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/Flask/) allows Flask apps to be created and run online, however you will need to read their documentation as there are some minor differences in how you configure Flask to run online.
